Now is a critical time to return to (our) nature and get curious about the intersection of nature with different mediums and practices.\n\nDPR is a platform for information exchange and creative expression. We need forums beyond social media and the workplace where people are encouraged to learn, experiment, and share ideas.\n\n[why radio]\n\nThe contemporary definition of \u201cradio\u201d has evolved, expanding beyond the technology and practice of transmitting sound via electromagnetic waves. Especially in independent spaces, \u201cradio\u201d encompasses a shared culture and community.\n\nDesire Path Radio celebrates radio broadcast as an accessible tool for discourse, entertainment, and world-building. Radio is, and always has been, radical.\n\n[what is a desire path]\n\nDesire paths are unofficial routes created by repeated traffic. Reflecting the patterns of human nature and both individual and collective will, these routes reveal an alternate, if not improved, way to move through space and interact with the world around us.\n\nDIY forever.",

As an avid listener of Nigerian Highlife and Congolese Soukous, these genres make him gravitate towards tasteful grooves and movement in his selections.A disco ball purchase inspired him to start a diy dance party series called 'NO SQUARES' to help give exposure to bedroom DJs and celebrate house party culture. Apart from spinning house, he helps organize mass picnics to help combat urban isolation and build community especially for people that are new to Los Angeles.Community is everything for him as he seeks to build it on and off the dance floor.",
