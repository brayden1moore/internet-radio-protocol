Having released a series of podcasts over lockdown, it was a natural next step to start an online radio station, further spotlighting the community work of the network of organisers we'd met through our conversations.",

Inspired by the title of a poem anthology edited by Paul Juhasz, \u2018The Working Man's Hand' celebrates the cultural impact music legend Woody Guthrie left on the world through his songs of protest, social justice, and activism. Guthrie's impact has led to the foundation for various American icons, including household names ( such as Bob Dylan and Bruce Springsteen of course) as well as countless other emerging artists who use activism in their music, poetry or lyrics. This program aims to highlight both old and new music relevant to the struggles of the working class and marginalized communities shaped throughout history but also to play music relevant to the general American experience\u2014-All between genres of primarily Folk/Blues/Country and Rock, but trickling in sounds across categories too. Whether it's screaming off the top of your lungs about that cruel workday, making fun of the systems that have wronged you or simply contemplating the hurdles of life whilst under the midwestern sun, it's all music by the people for the people.",
