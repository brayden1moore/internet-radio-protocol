Foreign Exchange won't simply highlight dance producers from the global diaspora, but on irreplicable creative movements happening outside the English speaking world. With a different focus every week (whether genre, nation, label, artist, scene, or era), Foreign Exchange presents an anthropological, Anglo-exclusionary perspective on electronic dance music.",
