DPR is a platform for information exchange and creative expression. We need forums beyond social media and the workplace where people are encouraged to learn, experiment, and share ideas. [why radio] The contemporary definition of \u201cradio\u201d has evolved, expanding beyond the technology and practice of transmitting sound via electromagnetic waves. Especially in independent spaces, \u201cradio\u201d encompasses a shared culture and community. Desire Path Radio celebrates radio broadcast as an accessible tool for discourse, entertainment, and world-building. Radio is, and always has been, radical. [what is a desire path] Desire paths are unofficial routes created by repeated traffic. Reflecting the patterns of human nature and both individual and collective will, these routes reveal an alternate, if not improved, way to move through space and interact with the world around us.

        "about": "Previously a nomadic club series called Ossia that threw parties up and down the country over the last decade, headlined by the likes of Leon Vynehall, Chaos In The CBD, and Shanti Celeste, we rebranded as Voices in 2020 as a platform to tackle social issues through panels and events. Having released a series of podcasts over lockdown, it was a natural next step to start an online radio station, further spotlighting the community work of the network of organisers we'd met through our conversations.",
