Having released a series of podcasts over lockdown, it was a natural next step to start an online radio station, further spotlighting the community work of the network of organisers we'd met through our conversations.",

    "nowPlayingDescriptionLong": "The Third Rail is the embodiment of the reality of the human condition through stark lyricism and thrashing melodies. The soul focus of the tracks played on Third Rail will be a blend of post-punk jazz fusion, with elements of politics and social commentary. As we dive into the tracks post run, I will be providing listeners with an inside look of the intentions, meaning, message and emotions of each track. Furthermore, at the beginning of the show, I will give a very brief oration of the state of the world, or a new story. Listeners of the show come in and leave with a goal of achieving a higher consciousness. I plan to carry this narrative throughout the time on my show, eventually branching out into different genres in the same stratosphere of existentialism. Lastly, at any time, certain bands, no matter where from, will come on the show to give a performance, with an interview following. The Third Rail will transport you to a grander scale of thought, providing enlightenment to all who tune in.",
