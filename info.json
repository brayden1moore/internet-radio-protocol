We need forums beyond social media and the workplace where people are encouraged to learn, experiment, and share ideas.\n\n[why radio]\n\nThe contemporary definition of \u201cradio\u201d has evolved, expanding beyond the technology and practice of transmitting sound via electromagnetic waves. Especially in independent spaces, \u201cradio\u201d encompasses a shared culture and community.\n\nDesire Path Radio celebrates radio broadcast as an accessible tool for discourse, entertainment, and world-building. Radio is, and always has been, radical.\n\n[what is a desire path]\n\nDesire paths are unofficial routes created by repeated traffic. Reflecting the patterns of human nature and both individual and collective will, these routes reveal an alternate, if not improved, way to move through space and interact with the world around us.\n\nDIY forever.",
