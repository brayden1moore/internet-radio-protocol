        "about": "Previously a nomadic club series called Ossia that threw parties up and down the country over the last decade, headlined by the likes of Leon Vynehall, Chaos In The CBD, and Shanti Celeste, we rebranded as Voices in 2020 as a platform to tackle social issues through panels and events. Having released a series of podcasts over lockdown, it was a natural next step to start an online radio station, further spotlighting the community work of the network of organisers we'd met through our conversations.",
